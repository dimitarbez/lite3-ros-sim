## 1 UDP Commands

Communication with the motion host adopts UDP protocol, and the raw data is stored

by little-endian.

When developers send messages to the motion host, the target port is 43893 and please

refer to Lite3_MotionSDK section 4.1 to obtain the target IP.

By default, the motion host only reports data to the perception host. If developers need

to receive data reported by the motion host, please refer to Lite3_MotionSDK section 4

and section 5 to connect to the motion host via SSH, modify the data receiving address

to the static IP of the development host.

### 1.1 Protocol Format

This section introduces the raw data format transmitted by UDP protocol. Based on

whether complex data is carried, UDP commands can be divided into two categories:

simple commands and complex commands.

#### 1.1.1 Simple Commands

The format of a simple command is [xxxx yyyy zzzz], with each letter representing a

byte.

The raw data of a simple command is stored in CommandHead structure.

    struct CommandHead{
    uint32_t code;
    uint32_t paramters_size;
    uint32_t type;
    };

<!-- PDF page 5 -->

xxxx represents the value of CommandHead.code, indicating the command code.

yyyy stands for the value of CommandHead.paramters_size, indicating the value of the

command code. When the command code does not have a valid value, yyyy = 0.

zzzz refers to the value of CommandHead.type, used to differentiate various command

type. The type value for simple command is 0, i.e., zzzz = 0.

Example of usage:

    // Example Program
    struct CommandHead command_head = {0};
    command_head.code = 1;            // Command Code
    command_head.paramters_size = 0;// Command Value
    command_head.type = 0;            // Command Type
    sendto(sfd,&command_head,sizeof(command_head), Target Address, Address Length)

#### 1.1.2 Complex Commands

Complex commands carry specific data content in the format of [xxxx yyyy zzzz

bbbbbbbb……], with each letter representing a byte.

The raw data for complex command is stored in Command structure.
    struct CommandHead{
    uint32_t code;
    uint32_t paramters_size;
    uint32_t type;
    };
    const uint32_t kDataSize = 256;
    struct Command{
    CommandHead head;
    uint32_t data[kDataSize];
    };

xxxx represents the value of Command.head.code, indicating the command code.

<!-- PDF page 6 -->

yyyy stands for the value of Command.head.paramters_size, indicating the length of

bbbbbbbb…….

zzzz refers to the value of Command.head.type, used to differentiate various command

type. The type value for complex command is 1, i.e., zzzz = 1.

bbbbbbbb…… defines the value of Command.data, representing the data carried by the

command.

Example of usage:
    // Example Program
    int32_t to_be_send_data[64];
    struct Command command = {0};
    command.head.code = 52; // Command Code
    command.head.paramters_size = sizeof(to_be_send_data);// Data Length
    command.type = 1;            // Command Type
    memcpy(&command.data,&to_be_send_data,sizeof(to_be_send_data));
    sendto(sfd,&command,sizeof(command.head)+command.head.paramters_size, Target Address, Address
    Length);

#### 1.1.3 Receiving Complex Commands

Taking joint velocity as an example, the usage is as follows:
    struct RobotJointVel{
    double joint_vel[12];
    }; // Take joint velocity as an example
    struct CommandMessage{
    CommandHead command;
    uint8_t data_buffer[1024];
    };
    CommandMessage cm;
    size_t recv_size = 0;
    recv_size = recvfrom(server_fd,&cm,sizeof(cm),0,(sockaddr*)&client_addr,&sockaddr_in_size);
    if(cm.command.type == 1){ // Check if it is a complex command
    if(recv_size == cm.command.paramters_size + sizeof(cm.command)){
    uint8_t* temp_values = new uint8_t[cm.command.paramters_size];
    memcpy(temp_values,cm.data_buffer,cm.command.paramters_size);
    if(cm.command.code == 0x0903){ // Check the command code and parse the data

<!-- PDF page 7 -->

    RobotJointVel *joint_vel = (RobotJointVel *)temp_values;
    }
    }
    }

### 1.2 Control Command Set

Developers control the robot and achieve corresponding functions by directly sending

commands to the motion host through UDP protocol. However, sending messages does

not change the original control logic.

Jueying Lite3 can receive messages from multiple controllers at the same time. The

command of "0x2*******" can be sent by multiple clients, but the downstream data,

originating from the wide camera, can only be sent to the client that initially connected

to the robot.

#### 1.2.1 Heartbeat

The heartbeat command is used to verify the stability of the connection and should be

sent at a minimal frequency of 2Hz.

Command Code                   Command Value                        Command Type

0x21040001                            -                                 0

[Note] The minus sign - means the command value is meaningless, i.e., the command value will
not act on the command.

<!-- PDF page 8 -->

#### 1.2.2 Commands for Switching Between Basic States

The switch between robot's basic states is achieved by giving corresponding commands,

as shown in the following figure (the corresponding code indicated in parentheses is

status value).

Some of the commands are shown in the table below:

<!-- PDF page 9 -->

Command              Code          Value       Type     Function

Stand/Sit       0x21010202           -           0      Switch between sitting state and standing state

STOP            0x21020C0E           -           0      Enables software-based emergency stop

Reset to Zero   0x21010C05           -           0      Initialize the robot's joints

#### 1.2.3 Axis Command

Axis command is the command output from x-axis and y-axis of the two joysticks of the

controller, with a value range of: [−32767,32767].

##### 1.2.3.1 Axis Command in Pose Mode

In pose mode, the client can change the robot's postures by sending axis command to

the motion host. If the motion host doesn't receive any axis command for more than

one second, the system will consider the command invalid and the robot will return to

its normal standing position. If the axis command value is within the dead zone range,

it is considered as 0.
Dead Zone
Command                     Code         Value                            Function
Range
Adjust Roll Angle     0x21010131           0          [-12553,12553]      Positive value rolls to the right

Adjust Pitch Angle    0x21010130           0           [-6553,6553]       Positive value lowers the head

Adjust Body Height    0x21010102           0          [-20000,20000]      Positive value raises the body

Adjust Yaw Angle      0x21010135           0           [-9553,9553]       Positive value rotates to the right

##### 1.2.3.2 Axis Command in Move Mode

In move mode, the client can change robot's moving direction and speed by sending

axis commands to the motion host. The issue frequency of axis command should not

be lower than 20Hz. If the motion host has not received any axis command for more

than 250 ms, the command will be considered as invalid by the system and the robot

<!-- PDF page 10 -->

will stop moving. When the axis command value is within the dead zone, it is

considered as 0, and the robot stops moving. The positive and negative values of the

axis command determine the direction of the speed.

Command             Code       Value    Dead Zone       Function

Specifies the expected linear

Translation                                             velocity of the robot along the y-
0x21010131    0      [-12553,12553]
(Left/Right)
axis, with positive value indicating
moving to the right.
Specifies the expected linear

Translation                                              velocity of the robot along the x-
0x21010130    0       [-6553,6553]
(Forward/Backward)
axis, with positive value indicating
moving forward.
Specifies the expected angular
velocity of the robot, with positive
Turning Left/Right   0x21010135    0       [-9553,9553]
value indicating turning to the
right.

##### 1.2.3.3 Stop Command

In move mode, if the axis command is 0, the robot will stop moving.

#### 1.2.4 Commands for Switching Between Motion Modes

Command Name             Command Code               Command Value           Command Type
